Running Tests with Jest

This project uses Jest as the testing framework. Follow the instructions below to run the tests and interpret the test results.

Prerequisites

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

Installation

npm install

This command installs all project dependencies, including Jest and other necessary packages.

Run Tests

To run all tests, use the following command:

npm test

Alternatively, you can use Jest CLI directly:

npx jest

To run a specific test file, use:

npx jest <test-file-name>

Test Coverage

To generate and view test coverage reports, run:

npm run test:coverage

This command will generate coverage reports in various formats, including JSON, Lcov, text, and Clover.

Interpreting Test Results

After running the tests, Jest will provide output indicating the status of each test. Here are common outcomes:

    ✅ Passed: The test has passed successfully.
    ❌ Failed: The test has failed, and additional information about the failure will be displayed.
    ⚠️ Skipped: The test was skipped, and Jest will provide information on why it was skipped.

Feel free to customize the documentation based on your specific needs. Update the placeholders like <test-file-name> with the actual names of your test files.
